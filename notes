possible egui bug:
rendering multiple items in scrollview, using
ui.with_layout(egui::Layout::right_to_left(),...
first item fills entire visible panel!

TODO next:
add buttons to selected project window
make main window inactive when displaing an overlay window
change delete buttons to edit buttons and use a window to edit/delete
make project selection window not flicker (better logic for when to generate and clear random index)
if no projects exist, show a nice big way to add them
maybe do alternating colour project backgrounds for easier list viewing
hover on delete buttons could highlight the relevant project
